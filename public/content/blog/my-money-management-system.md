## Overview

Managing money can be overwhelming, but I've developed a system that automates most of the process and gives me peace of mind. My approach combines Google Sheets for tracking, automatic bank transfers for execution, and strategic credit card usage for spending control.

## The Foundation: Dual Paychecks

I receive two paychecks per month—one on the 15th and one at the end of the month. Both are deposited directly into my primary savings account, which serves as the central hub for all my financial operations. This dual-paycheck structure allows me to split my financial planning into two equal halves, making the math simpler and more manageable.

## Tracking Expenses with Google Sheets

The heart of my system is a comprehensive Google Sheet that tracks all recurring expenses. Each expense is categorized by:

- **Type**: Mortgage, utilities, subscriptions, debt payments, etc.
- **Deduction Date**: When the expense is pulled from my account
- **Frequency**: Monthly or annual
- **Payment Method**: Whether it must come from my Bills Checking account or from a Credit Card

This spreadsheet serves multiple purposes:

1. **Visibility**: I can see exactly where my money goes
2. **Calendar Integration**: The data is exported to my Google Calendar so I can visualize when expenses are due
3. **Planning**: It forms the basis for all my financial calculations

## The Math: Income Allocation

Once I have a clear picture of my expenses, I perform some key calculations:

1. **Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses** = Available Funds
2. **Split Available Funds** into three buckets:

   - **20%** → Emergency Fund
   - **40%** → Investments
   - **40%** → Credit Card Payments (subscriptions + spending)

3. **Halve Each Amount** to account for my two paychecks per month

This allocation ensures I'm building my emergency fund, growing my investments, and covering my spending—all while maintaining clear boundaries between these categories.

## Automation: Set It and Forget It

Using these calculated amounts, I've set up automatic transfers in my bank that execute on both the 15th and the end of each month. This automation ensures:

- Money is always where it needs to be, when it needs to be there
- I don't have to remember to make transfers manually
- The system runs consistently, even if I'm busy or forgetful
- All accounts are funded appropriately before expenses are due

## Credit Card Strategy

I use a two-card system to separate different types of spending:

1. **Subscriptions Card**: Handles all recurring subscriptions (streaming services, software, etc.)
2. **General Spending Card**: Used for variable expenses like food, gas, and other day-to-day purchases

For my general spending card, I have a usage alert set up so I know when I'm approaching my monthly spending limit. This prevents overspending and keeps me accountable.

At the end of each month, both credit cards are paid in full. This approach:

- Ensures I never carry a balance or pay interest
- Gives me a clean slate each month
- Maximizes credit card rewards without debt
- Maintains excellent credit health

## Why This System Works

This money management system has several key advantages:

- **Automation**: Most of the work happens automatically, reducing mental load
- **Transparency**: I always know where my money is and where it's going
- **Discipline**: The allocation percentages ensure I'm saving and investing consistently
- **Flexibility**: The system adapts if my income or expenses change—I just update the spreadsheet
- **Peace of Mind**: Knowing everything is automated and accounted for reduces financial stress

## Getting Started

If you're interested in setting up a similar system, start with:

1. **Track everything**: Create a comprehensive list of all your recurring expenses
2. **Calculate your numbers**: Determine your income allocation percentages based on your goals
3. **Set up automation**: Work with your bank to create automatic transfers
4. **Use tools**: Leverage spreadsheets and calendar integrations for visibility
5. **Review regularly**: Check in monthly to ensure everything is working as expected

Remember, the best money management system is one you'll actually use consistently. Start simple, automate what you can, and adjust as needed.
