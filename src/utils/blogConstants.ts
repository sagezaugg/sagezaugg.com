    body: `## Why a New Website?

I decided to rebuild my website for several key reasons:

* **Better performance** - Optimized for speed and responsiveness
* **Modern design** - Clean, intuitive interface with a Zelda-inspired theme
* **Improved user experience** - Enhanced navigation and readability
* **Easier maintenance** - Modern tech stack for simpler updates

## Tech Stack

The new website is built with modern technologies:

* **React** - For building interactive UI components
* **TypeScript** - Adding type safety to the codebase
* **Tailwind CSS** - For beautiful, responsive styling

Stay tuned for more updates as the development progresses! Feel free to [check out the repository](https://github.com/sagezaugg/sagezaugg.com) to see the progress.`,
